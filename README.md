# Haskell-Practice
Practicing some Haskell ideas

# Queue.hs
Implements deque in Haskell with amortised constant time operation  
Idea from https://rafal.io/posts/haskell-queues.html  

# NumStruc.hs/NumStrucExamples.hs
Practising the usage of State Monad, lazy IO and strict IO  
Computes the infinite list of any accumulative integral list, where we can determine if n is an element of the list when we all the elements smaller than n  
As an example, prints out infinite list of primes and Ulam Numbers using a custom filter function with accumulators  
* The list of Ulam Number starts with 1, 2 and all other Ulam numbers can be expressed as the sum of two distinct ulam numbers in exactly one way  

# BTree.hs
Implements Binary Search Tree in Haskell  

# Trie.hs
Implements Set based on Trie  

# SkewCollatz.hs
An interesting conjecture regarding a modified Collatz Sequence  

# IntegralPyramid.hs 
A competition puzzle. Details inside  

# Division.hs  
Simulates an ALU-leveldivision algorithm as part of a Computer Architecture course tutorial  

# Closure.hs
Calculates closure and minimal key (relational database)
